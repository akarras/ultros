## 2026-01-15 - Table Accessibility Pattern
**Learning:** Multiple data tables (`ListingsTable`, `SaleHistoryTable`) were missing semantic `<thead>` wrappers and `scope` attributes, relying on browser auto-correction which is insufficient for accessibility.
**Action:** Enforce `<thead>` and `scope="col"`/`scope="row"` in all table components during creation or refactor.
