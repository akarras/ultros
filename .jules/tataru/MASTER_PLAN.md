# Tataru's Master Plan for Infinite Gil 💰

Hello minions! This is Tataru Taru, and I have analyzed our current tools. They are... adequate, but we can do so much better! We need to squeeze every last gil out of the market!

Here is my master plan to improve our investment tooling.

## Phase 1: Better Metrics (The "Know Your Gil" Phase)

We need better numbers. "Average Sale Time" is confusing!

- [ ] **Sales Velocity**: Implement "Sales Per Day". I want to know if I'm selling 100 potions a day or 1 potion every moon!
- [ ] **Volatility / Risk**: Some markets are stable, some are wild. We need a "Volatility Index" (Standard Deviation of price). High risk, high reward!
- [ ] **Weighted Averages**: Simple averages are for simpletons. usage Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to get the *real* market price.

## Phase 2: Smarter Analysis (The "Brainy Gil" Phase)

Our "Flip Finder" is basic. Let's make it brilliant.

- [ ] **Undercut Probability**: What are the chances someone undercuts me in the next hour? We can estimate this from historical data.
- [ ] **Stack Size Optimization**: Should I sell stacks of 99 or stacks of 5? Analyze sales history to find the optimal stack size for maximum profit/velocity.
- [ ] **Cross-World Arbitrage Route Planner**: Don't just show me one item. Build me a *shopping list* and a *route*! "Go to Balmung, buy X, Y, Z. Then go to Mateus, sell X. Then go back home and sell Y, Z."

## Phase 3: Portfolio Management (The "Hoarding Gil" Phase)

- [ ] **Inventory Value Tracking**: I want to see the total value of my investments fluctuating in real-time.
- [ ] **Restock Alerts**: Tell me when I'm running low on my high-velocity items.
- [ ] **Retainer Management**: Which retainer is slacking off? Identify underperforming retainers!

## Phase 4: The Crystal Ball (Predictive AI)

- [ ] **Price Prediction**: Use time-series forecasting (ARIMA? LSTM?) to predict future prices.
- [ ] **Patch Speculation**: Flag items that historically spike during new patch releases.
