## 2024-05-24 - External Links
**Learning:** Links to external tools (like Garland Tools) disrupt the user flow if they open in the same tab. Users often want to cross-reference data.
**Action:** Configure external tool links to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security, and add an `aria-label` to inform screen reader users of the context switch (e.g., "(opens in new tab)").
