# Retainers

Ultros is able to track retainers and give a summary. You must be logged into a Discord account.

The website and Discord bot stay in sync, so as long as you use the same account you should be able to view retainers added via the website
on the bot, or retainers added via the bot on the website.

Once you add retainers to your account you should be able to view them on the website like this:
![An example of the website undercuts page](./undercuts_page.png)

If you're logged in, you can view this page yourself [here](https://ultros.app/retainers/undercuts), or by clicking on the retainers button
and then clicking the undercuts button.
