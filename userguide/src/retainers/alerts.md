# Retainer Undercut Alerts

## Adding alerts to a channel
Currently ultros only supports alerting via Discord.

Once you've added retainers to your account, you can request to get alerts from the bot using `/ffxiv retainer add_undercut_alert`

If you have the bot in the server you're in, it should look something like this:
![discord command picker](./undercut_alert_command.png)

Once you use this command in a Discord channel- it should send an alert similar to this to that channel.

By default, alerts will mention you and look like this
![undercut](./discord_alert.png)

## Turning alerts off
To remove alerts from a channel, you may use the `/ffxiv retainer remove_undercut_alert` command to stop alerts from being sent to a channel
