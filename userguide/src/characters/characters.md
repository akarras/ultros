# Characters

In Ultros, linking a Final Fantasy XIV character to your account unlocks features that require character identity, such as:

*   **Retainer Tracking**: View your retainers and their sales.
*   **Undercut Alerts**: Receive notifications when your retainers are undercut.

By verifying your character, you prove ownership of the character on the Lodestone, allowing Ultros to securely associate that character's data with your account.
