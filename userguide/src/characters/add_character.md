# Adding a Character

To add a character to your Ultros account:

1.  Navigate to the **Profile Settings** page (usually found in the user menu).
2.  Click the **Add Character** button.
3.  Enter your character's name in the search box and click the search icon.
4.  Find your character in the search results and click **Claim**.
5.  You will be given a verification code (e.g., `Ultros-Claim-12345`).
6.  **Copy this code** and paste it into your character's profile on the **Lodestone** (e.g., in the bio/introduction section).
7.  Wait for the verification process to complete. You can verify the status in the "Pending Verifications" section of the Profile Settings page.

Once verified, your character will appear in your "Characters" list, and you can start using character-specific features.
