# Managing Profile & Characters

The [Profile](/profile) page is your central hub for account management on Ultros. Here you can configure global settings and manage your claimed characters.

## World Settings

- **Home World**: Setting your home world defaults various tools (like Flip Finder) to use this world. It also customizes the navigation experience.
- **Default Price Zone**: This determines which region, datacenter, or world prices are shown for by default when browsing the Item Explorer.

## Crafter Settings

If you use the [Recipe Analyzer](/recipe-analyzer), you can set your crafter levels here. This allows the analyzer to filter recipes based on your character's capabilities.

## Ad Settings

Ultros offers an option to disable ads directly in the settings. While we appreciate users who leave ads enabled to support the site, we respect your choice to have an ad-free experience.

- **Ads Disabled/Enabled**: Toggle this switch to hide or show ads.

## Characters

The Characters section displays all the FFXIV characters you have claimed and verified.

- **Claimed Characters**: You will see a list of your verified characters with their name and world.
- **Unclaim**: To remove a character from your account, click the trash icon next to the character's name.

## Delete Account

**Warning**: This action is permanent.

If you wish to remove all your data from Ultros, you can use the "Delete Account" section. You must toggle the confirmation switch before the "Delete my account" button becomes active.
