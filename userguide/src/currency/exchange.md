# Currency Exchange

The **Currency Exchange** tool helps you convert non-tradable currencies (like Grand Company Seals, Scrips, or Tomestones) into Gil by identifying the most profitable items to purchase and sell on the market board.

## How to Use

1.  **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [Currency Exchange](/currency-exchange) from the Apps menu.
2.  **Select Currency**: Browse or search for the currency you want to spend (e.g., "Storm Seal", "White Scrip").
3.  **Input Amount**: Enter the amount of currency you have available.
4.  **Analyze Results**: The tool will list items you can buy with that currency, sorted by potential profit.

## Understanding the Results

The results table shows potential trades:

-   **Shops**: Where you can buy the item.
-   **Cost**: The currency cost per item.
-   **Item**: The item you receive.
-   **Price/item**: The estimated market board price per item.
-   **Qty recv**: How many items you can buy with your total currency.
-   **Profit**: The total estimated profit (Price/item * Quantity).
-   **Hours/sale**: A metric indicating how fast the item sells. Lower numbers mean faster sales.

## Tips

-   **Check Sales Velocity**: High profit doesn't mean much if the item takes months to sell. Look for items with a low "Hours/sale" value.
-   **Diversify**: Instead of spending all your currency on one item that might flood the market, consider buying a mix of profitable items.
