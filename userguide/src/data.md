# Data notice

Ultros relies on Universalis for data- and might not be always up to date. If you are at the retainer bell and check your retainer's related prices, it will remove the listing from Universalis and thus Ultros as well. If you need the listing to show up immediately, you should check the market board without using the retainer bell.

In order to update Ultros' data, you should [contribute to Universalis](https://universalis.app/contribute).
