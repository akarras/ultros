# Recipe Analyzer

The **Recipe Analyzer** is a tool designed to help you find profitable crafting recipes. It analyzes the market data for the selected world to calculate the potential profit and Return on Investment (ROI) for crafting items.

## How to Use

1.  **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [Recipe Analyzer](/recipe-analyzer) from the Apps menu.
2.  **Select World**: Choose the world you want to analyze data for.
3.  **Configure Crafter Levels**: To see relevant recipes, you must configure your crafter levels. Click on "Adjust Crafter Levels" to set your level for each class. The analyzer will only show recipes you can craft.
4.  **Filters**: Use the filter cards to narrow down the results:
    -   **Minimum Profit**: Filter out recipes with low profit.
    -   **Minimum ROI**: Filter by Return on Investment percentage.
    -   **Minimum Daily Sales**: Filter by sales velocity to ensure the item actually sells.
    -   **Job Filter**: Focus on specific crafting jobs.
5.  **Options**:
    -   **Include Sub-crafts**: Checks if it's cheaper to craft intermediate ingredients rather than buying them.
    -   **Require HQ Ingredients**: Calculates cost assuming you buy High Quality ingredients.

## Understanding the Data

The results table displays the following columns:

-   **Item**: The crafted item name and icon.
-   **Profit**: The estimated profit (Market Price - Crafting Cost).
-   **ROI**: Return on Investment percentage. High ROI means you get a lot of profit relative to the cost.
-   **Cost / unit**: The estimated cost to craft one unit. Hover over the "sub" icon (if present) to see the breakdown of sub-crafts.
-   **Price**: The current lowest market board price.
-   **Daily Sales**: The estimated number of sales per day.
-   **Avg Price**: The average sale price from recent history.

## Tips

-   Use the **Daily Sales** filter to avoid "trap" items that have high profit margins but never sell.
-   Enable **Sub-crafts** to find hidden margins where crafting intermediate materials significantly reduces costs.
