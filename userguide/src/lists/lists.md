# Lists

Lists in Ultros allow you to track items, recipes, or materials for various purposes, such as crafting projects, market monitoring, or shopping lists.

## Creating a List

1.  Navigate to the **Lists** page (`/list`).
2.  Click the **+ (Plus)** button to create a new list.
3.  Enter a **Name** for your list.
4.  Select a **World, Datacenter, or Region** filter. This filter determines the pricing data shown for items in this list.
5.  Click the **Save** button.

## Managing Lists

On the **Edit Lists** page (`/lists`), you can:

*   **Filter** your lists by name.
*   **Edit** a list's name or world filter by clicking the pencil icon.
*   **Delete** a list by clicking the trash icon.

## Adding Items to a List

You can add items to a list from any item page or search result that displays the "Add to List" button (list icon with a plus).

1.  Click the **Add to List** button on an item.
2.  In the modal that appears, select the **Quantity** and whether you want the **High Quality (HQ)** version.
3.  Click the **Add** button next to the list you want to add the item to.

## Viewing a List

Clicking on a list name takes you to the list view, where you can see the items in that list, their quantities, and market data based on the list's configured filter.
