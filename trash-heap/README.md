# 🗑️ Trash Heap Info

This project came about through many trial and errors. Originally the plan was to create an egui native desktop application, but eventually it became
clear that making a web interface made more sense.

### Repositories
* `crafterstoolbox` - abandoned egui frontend that would price out all ingredients and give charts of demand
* `recipepricecheck` - abandoned repo that wrapped universalis' api to figure out how much it'd cost to craft an item
* `xivapi` - abandoned xivapi scraper, deprecated in favor of `xiv-gen`
